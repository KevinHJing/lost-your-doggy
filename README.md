# LostYourDoggy

**A web application made by Kevin Jing, Shashank Bhatt, and Katrina Baniak with the help of Stephanie Yang. Developed for VandyHacks2020.**

## Description
Losing a family pet can be devastating. So, to help people through these tramatic times, we've made LostYourDoggy. LostYourDoggy is a web application that allows those who've lost or found a pet to upload an image of the animal. Using an AI/ML algorithm, our application can match the different images uploaded by the original owner and the finder of the same pet. Our algorithm is accurate with over 80% of cases. After matching, users can contact the finders/original owners so that the lost pets can be returned. Hopefully, we can reconnect families with their lost pets and help relieve a lot of pain from such a troubling experience.
